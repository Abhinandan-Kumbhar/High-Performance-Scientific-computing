## Implemented parallel computing frameworks to parallelize 0th order Generalized Mode Acceleration Method
### Implemented Guyan condensation for model order reduction to scale down the system size by 7 times using MATLAB code  
**Refer to Abstract**  
The **3728** system is reduced to **500** i.e. 7 times mode order reduction
  
### Achieved 5 times speedup in code runtime with OpenMP,MPI and CUDA frameworks on ParamSanganak supercomputer in IITKanpur  
**Refer to Results and discussion on page 4**
