### Project title  
## Implemented parallel computing frameworks to parallelize 0th order Generalized Mode Acceleration Method
**1. Implemented Guyan condensation for model order reduction to scale down the system size by 7 times using MATLAB code**
**2.Developed the CUDA kernels and MPI data-sharing frameworks in C code for generalized eigenvalue analysis and dynamics analysis**  
**3. Achieved 5 times speedup in code runtime with OpenMP,MPI and CUDA frameworks on ParamSanganak supercomputer in IITKanpur**

   **Refer to Abstract**  
   The **3728** system is reduced to **500** i.e. 7 times mode order reduction
