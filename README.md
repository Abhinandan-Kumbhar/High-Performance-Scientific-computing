### Project title  
## Implemented parallel computing frameworks to parallelize 0th order Generalized Mode Acceleration Method
### 1. Implemented Guyan condensation for model order reduction to scale down the system size by 7 times using MATLAB code  
    **Proof**  
    **Refer to Abstract**  
    The **3728** system is reduced to **500** i.e. 7 times mode order reduction

### 2. Achieved 5 times speedup in code runtime with OpenMP,MPI and CUDA frameworks on ParamSanganak supercomputer in IITKanpur  
    **Proof**  
    **Refer to Results and discussion on page 4**
