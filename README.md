## Summary
Implemented parallel computing frameworks like OpenMP, MPI and CUDA on Param Sanganak, IIT Kanpur to parallelize the 0th order generalized mode acceleration method
## Resume points and their proofs
**1. Implemented Guyan condensation for Model Order Reduction to scale down the system size by 7 times using MATLAB code**  

   <ins>**Proof**</ins>  
   **Refer to Abstract**: The **3728** system is reduced to **500** i.e. 7 times mode order reduction
